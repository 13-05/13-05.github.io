      <section>
        <p>In light of the recent <a href="#">Chromium Manifest V3 plans</a>, now is a better time to move away from Chromium-based browsers than ever.</p>

        <p>(PS: Mental Outlaw has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2otiFy4ADI">a great video on Librewolf</a>, and I'd highly recommend you to check it out! He goes a lot more in depth with its features.)

        <p>The Firefox-based browser is one of the best options for both privacy and usability, for a number of reasons.</p>

        <ol class="list">
          <li>The most obvious benefit, Chromium MV3 won't affect it.</li>
          <li>It's <a href="https://reddit.com/r/FirefoxCSS/">highly customizable</a>!</li>
          <li>It uses less resources than most Chromium based browsers.</li>
          <li>The defaults are <i>very</i>privacy centric. If that's not your thing, you can change them to normal defaults.</li>
          <li>No Mozilla analytics! Since it's a fork of the Firefox source code, analytics that may be collected by Mozilla in the traditional Firefox browser simply aren't.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>The list goes on. The main reason I'm on Librewolf is because it's clear Google has no plans to revert the MV3 plans affecting adblock, and I think a fork of Chromium that maintains the old standards will just die off, or be more work than it's worth. With Librewolf, you don't need to worry about any of that, because the ecosystem is already there!</p>

        <p>So, what's the conclusion to draw here? Well, maybe it's time to change your browser! It doesn't have to be Librewolf specifically, but most Chromium based browsers are going through with Manifest V3, and so a Firefox fork is likely the best type of browser to switch to.</p>
